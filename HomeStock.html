    <h1>HomeStock</h1>
    <p>HomeStock is an app that one could use to keep an eye on the item they have in their house.</p>
    <p>This project was made in Android Studios and we coded in Java. <br></p>

    <P>HomeStock is one of the first projects not decided by Full Sail that I worked on.</P>
    <p>I worked on the front-end elements mostly. I did dabble in the back end code nearing the end of the project</p>
    <p>I think the thing I am most proud of is the navigation bar and the home screen. <br></p>

    <p> <br>It's been a long time since Project and portfolio 1 so, I dont remember much about the project.</p>
    <p>What I do remember is work with other using Git fo rthe first time,</p>
    <p>Trying not to step on other people's toes by coding too much, </p>
    <p>Having my first experience coding in Java.</p>
