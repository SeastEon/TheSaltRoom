    <h1>TheBasement</h1>
    <p>TheBasement is an app that is supposed to store junk information</p>
    <p>It was built using Android Studios, but instead of using Java I used kotlin <br></p>

    <p>I orginally, made theBasement because I was inspired by a file I have on my computer of the same name</p>
    <p>TheBasment text document was just a place where I stored random information that I may or may not ever use.</p>
    <p>TheBasement app was supposed to replicate this function, but it would save your information encyrpted to a database.</p>
    <p>This meant no memory had to be used to while using the program.</p>

    <p><br> I was actually amazed to load up the project and have it still run.</p>
    <p>From my experience working as a solo developer for TheBasement for 2 Months I learned how to develop changes quickly.</p>
    <p>From this experiecen I learnt what it means to be adaptable. Since we have a time crunch I could spend too long on spefic features</p>
    <p>Down below is the home page of the app. As you can see it's quite simple, but compact.</p>
